# Automated_MOM_generation
This project aims to automate the generation of meeting minutes from meeting transcripts. By processing transcriptions of meetings, the system identifies key points, decisions, and action items, and summarizes them into concise, well-organized minutes. This helps save time, improve accuracy, and streamline documentation for teams and organizations.
